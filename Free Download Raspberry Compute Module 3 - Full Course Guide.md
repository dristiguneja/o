## Understanding the Power of the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3

The Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3 (CM3) is a powerful System-on-Module (SoM) designed for embedded systems and industrial applications. Unlike the regular Raspberry Pi boards, the CM3 packs the core functionality of a Raspberry Pi into a smaller, more flexible form factor. This makes it ideal for integrating into custom hardware solutions, allowing developers to create innovative and specialized devices.

The key benefits of using the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3 include:

*   **Compact Size:** Its small size allows for integration into space-constrained environments.
*   **Customization:** It's designed to be integrated into custom carrier boards, providing unparalleled flexibility in hardware design.
*   **Performance:** It offers the same performance as the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
*   **Industrial Applications:** It's robust and reliable, making it perfect for industrial control, automation, and IoT deployments.
