## Diving Deeper: Specific Tactics Explored in the Course

*   **Triangulation:** Involving a third party in a conflict to manipulate the situation or create division. This often involves pitting people against each other to gain power.
*   **Guilt-Tripping:** Making someone feel guilty to get them to do what you want. This is a form of emotional blackmail that exploits the person's emotions.
*   **Playing the Victim:** Portraying oneself as a victim to gain sympathy and manipulate others into helping.

The course will provide detailed explanations of these tactics and offer strategies for recognizing and defending against them.
