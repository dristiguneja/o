## Understanding Console Output in C#

In C#, displaying information to the console is fundamental for debugging, providing user feedback, and creating interactive applications. While `println` is commonly associated with languages like Java, C# utilizes `Console.WriteLine()` and `Console.Write()` for similar functionality.

### `Console.WriteLine()` vs. `Console.Write()`

The key difference lies in how these methods handle the cursor position after outputting the text:

*   **`Console.WriteLine()`**: Prints the specified text to the console and then moves the cursor to the beginning of the next line.  This is the closest equivalent to `println`.

*   **`Console.Write()`**: Prints the specified text to the console but leaves the cursor on the same line immediately after the last character printed.

Here's a simple example illustrating the difference:

```csharp
using System;

public class Example
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.Write("This is the first part. ");
        Console.WriteLine("This is the second part.");
        Console.Write("This is on the same line.");
    }
}
```

The output of this code would be:

```
This is the first part. This is the second part.
This is on the same line.
```

### Basic Syntax of `Console.WriteLine()`

The `Console.WriteLine()` method is incredibly versatile and can accept various data types as input. Here's the basic syntax:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(value);
```

Where `value` can be:

*   A string literal (e.g., `"Hello, World!"`)
*   A variable of any data type (e.g., `int`, `string`, `float`, `bool`)
*   An expression that evaluates to a value

Let's look at some examples:

```csharp
using System;

public class Example
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string message = "Welcome to C#!";
        int age = 30;
        double price = 99.99;

        Console.WriteLine(message);  // Output: Welcome to C#!
        Console.WriteLine(age);      // Output: 30
        Console.WriteLine(price);    // Output: 99.99
    }
}
```

## Formatting Console Output

Beyond simply displaying values, C# provides powerful formatting options to control how information is presented in the console. This is crucial for creating readable and user-friendly output.

### Composite Formatting

Composite formatting allows you to embed placeholders within a string and then provide corresponding values to be inserted into those placeholders. The syntax is as follows:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("String with placeholders {0}, {1}, {2}", value0, value1, value2);
```

The numbers within the curly braces (`{}`) represent the index of the value to be inserted, starting from 0.

Here's an example:

```csharp
using System;

public class Example
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string name = "Alice";
        int score = 100;

        Console.WriteLine("Player {0} scored {1} points!", name, score);  // Output: Player Alice scored 100 points!
    }
}
```

### Numeric Formatting

Numeric formatting allows you to control the appearance of numbers, including the number of decimal places, the inclusion of currency symbols, and the use of thousands separators.  You can specify formatting strings within the curly braces of composite formatting.

Some common numeric formatting specifiers include:

*   **`C`**: Currency (e.g., `{0:C}` displays a number as currency based on the current culture)
*   **`D`**: Decimal (e.g., `{0:D4}` displays an integer with a minimum of 4 digits)
*   **`F`**: Fixed-point (e.g., `{0:F2}` displays a number with 2 decimal places)
*   **`N`**: Number (e.g., `{0:N}` displays a number with thousands separators)
*   **`P`**: Percent (e.g., `{0:P}` displays a number as a percentage)

Example:

```csharp
using System;

public class Example
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        double price = 1234.5678;

        Console.WriteLine("Price in currency: {0:C}", price);      // Output: Price in currency: $1,234.57 (assuming USD)
        Console.WriteLine("Price with two decimals: {0:F2}", price);  // Output: Price with two decimals: 1234.57
    }
}
```

### String Interpolation (C# 6 and later)

String interpolation provides a more concise and readable way to format strings. It allows you to embed expressions directly within a string using the `$` prefix and curly braces.

Example:

```csharp
using System;

public class Example
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string name = "Bob";
        int age = 25;

        Console.WriteLine($"Name: {name}, Age: {age}");  // Output: Name: Bob, Age: 25
    }
}
```

You can also use formatting specifiers within the interpolated string:

```csharp
using System;

public class Example
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        double temperature = 23.7;

        Console.WriteLine($"The temperature is {temperature:F1} degrees Celsius.");  // Output: The temperature is 23.7 degrees Celsius.
    }
}
```

## Beyond the Basics: Input from the Console

While `Console.WriteLine()` handles output, C# also provides methods for receiving input from the user through the console.  The primary method for this is `Console.ReadLine()`.

### `Console.ReadLine()`

`Console.ReadLine()` reads a line of text from the console and returns it as a string.

Example:

```csharp
using System;

public class Example
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.Write("Enter your name: ");
        string name = Console.ReadLine();

        Console.WriteLine($"Hello, {name}!");
    }
}
```

This code will prompt the user to enter their name, store the input in the `name` variable, and then display a personalized greeting.

### Converting Input

Since `Console.ReadLine()` always returns a string, you'll often need to convert the input to other data types, such as integers or doubles, using methods like `int.Parse()`, `int.TryParse()`, `double.Parse()`, or `double.TryParse()`. The `TryParse()` methods are generally preferred as they provide error handling if the input cannot be converted.

Example:

```csharp
using System;

public class Example
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.Write("Enter your age: ");
        string ageString = Console.ReadLine();

        if (int.TryParse(ageString, out int age))
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"You are {age} years old.");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Invalid age entered.");
        }
    }
}
```

## Common Errors and Troubleshooting

*   **`FormatException`**: This occurs when you attempt to convert a string to a different data type (e.g., using `int.Parse()`) and the string is not in the correct format. Use `TryParse()` methods to avoid this.
*   **Missing `using System;`**: If you forget to include `using System;` at the top of your code, you'll get an error because the `Console` class is defined in the `System` namespace.
*   **Incorrect formatting specifiers**: Double-check that your formatting specifiers (e.g., `{0:C}`) are correct for the data type you're trying to format.
